Code examples and exercises to learn AspectJ

#Prerequisites
The AspectJ compiler is delivered with the module `aspectj-tools` and it is usually enough to build any AspectJ project if the `aspectj-maven-plugin` is part of the build.
IntelliJ currently is bundled with the AspectJ plugin to provide support for building and running such projects from the IDE.
IntelliJ will not be able to do compile aspects until it mvn has downloaded the `aspectj-tools` jar.
